# Visual Studio Code Extensions Backuper and Installer
Backup and Install Visual Studio Code Extensions for Easy Transport!
## Requirements
- Code in PATH.
## Backup
- Run **"backup-extensions.sh"** or **"backup-extensions.bat"** to backup your extensions.

  The result should be something like this:

- Save the resulting file somewhere.
## Install

- It will install all the extensions to the computer you're in!

### TODO
- Let the user choose the filename / filepath (shouldn't be too difficult, was too lazy to do that)
