Backup and Install Visual Studio Code Extensions for Easy Transport!
## Backup
- Run **"backup-extensions.sh"** or **"backup-extensions.sh"** to backup your extensions.

  The result should be something like this:

- Save the resulting file somewhere.

### TODO
- Let the user choose the filename / filepath (shouldn't be too difficult, was too lazy to do that)
